                        <h3 id="sc1">Sweet & Spicy Sesame Sauce</h3>
                        Ingredients:
                        -ketchup
                        -sesame oil
                        -splash of rice vinegar 
                        -olive oil
                        -brown sugar or honey
                        -sriracha

                        Recipe
                        Use a lot of ketchup because this is the base (adds body to the sauce). Mix everything together adding sesame oil, sugar, an 
                        sriracha to taste depending how spicy/sweet you want it. Cook down sauce on medium-high heat, it should reduce significantly and 
                        will start to almost separate a bit.
                        -Note: this will taste kind of ketchupy when uncooked. 
                        -I recommend cooking chicken/tofu with the sauce on a high heat for a bit until the sugar in the sauce starts to caramelize/blacken
                                            
                    </li>

                        <span>Ingredients:
                            Ingredients:
                            -milk
                            -flour
                            -onion (you don't need much, it is just for flavor)
                            -nutmeg

                            Chop onion nice and fine and cook in butter until translucent. Add more butter (you want a decent amount). mix in a bit of flour to the butter and onion. This should be just enough to make it a past like consistency. Set heat to medium-low and add milk. Stir continuously until it thickens.

                        <span>
                            For 6 servings, or 2¼ to 2½ cups
                            2 tablespoons chopped yellow
                            onion
                            3 tablespoons olive oil
                            3 tablespoons butter
                            2 tablespoons chopped celery
                            2 tablespoons chopped carrot 
                            ¾ pound ground lean beef, preferably chuck or the meat from the neck
                            Salt
                            1 cup dry white wine
                            ½ cup milk
                            ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg
                            2 cups canned Italian tomatoes,
                            roughly chopped, with their juice
                            
                            
                            1. An earthenware pot should be your first choice for making ragu. If you don't have one available, use a heavy, enameled cast-iron casserole, the deepest one you have (to keep the ragu from reducing too quickly). Put in the chopped onion, with all the oil and butter, and sauté briefly over medium heat until just translucent. Add the celery and carrot and cook gently for 2 minutes.
                            2. Add the ground beet, crumbling it in the pot with a fork- Add 1 tablespoon salt, stir, and cook until the meat has lost its raw, red color. Add the wine, turn the heat up to medium high and cook stirring occasionally, until all the wine has evaporation
                            3. Turn the heat down to medium, add the milk and the nutmeg, and cook until the milk has evaporated. Stir frequently.
                            4 When the milk has evaporated, add the tomatoes, and stir thoroughly. When the tomatoes have started to bubble, turn the heat down until the sauce cooks at the laziest simmer, just an occasional bubble. Cook, uncovered, for a minimum of 3 ½ to 4 hours, stirring occasionally. Taste and correct for salt. (If you cannot watch the sauce for such a long stretch, you can turn off the heat and resume cooking it later on. But do finish cooking it in one day.)</span>
