                        <span>
                            4 Servings
                            ½ medium head of green cabbage (about 2 lb.)
                            2 medium shallots (about 4 oz.)
                            1 1" piece ginger
                            2 garlic cloves
                            1 serrano or other green chile
                            3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
                            1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
                            1 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk
                            1 15.5-oz. can chickpeas
                            1 tsp. brown mustard seeds
                            1 tsp. ground cumin
                            1 tsp. turmeric powder
                            ½ cup vegetable stock or water
                            Freshly ground black pepper
                            Steamed white rice, cilantro leaves, and lime wedges (for serving)

                            Step 1
                            To start, prep your ingredients: Slice ½ medium head of green cabbage (about 2 lb.) through core to make 4 wedges. Peel and finely chop 2 medium shallots (about 4 oz.). Peel one 1" piece ginger with a spoon and finely chop. Using the side of your knife, crush 2 garlic cloves, remove and discard papery skins, and finely chop. Halve 1 serrano or other green chile lengthwise and, if you don’t want it too hot, scrape out seeds and white membrane with the back of the knife; discard. If you prefer some heat, leave as is. Finely chop chile. Set shallots, ginger, garlic, and chile aside.
                            Step 2
                            Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large high-sided skillet with lid or wide Dutch oven over medium-high. Add cabbage, cut side down, and season with kosher salt. Cook, undisturbed, until lightly charred underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook, undisturbed, until charred, about 5 minutes. Transfer cabbage to a plate.
                            Step 3
                            Shake one 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk to ensure it’s well mixed; open can. Open one 15.5-oz. can chickpeas and rinse in a colander under running water.
                            Step 4
                            Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in same skillet over medium-high. Add reserved shallots, ginger, garlic, and chile, and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1 tsp. brown mustard seeds, 1 tsp. ground cumin, and 1 tsp. turmeric powder and cook, stirring, until mustard seeds are popping, about 1 minute.
                            Step 5
                            Add coconut milk, chickpeas, ½ cup vegetable stock or water, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Stir to combine.
                            Step 6
                            Place cabbage wedges back into pan and, using a large spoon, baste cabbage with coconut milk; bring mixture to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until cabbage is tender, 15–20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
                            Step 7
                            Scoop some steamed white rice into each bowl and divide cabbage and chickpeas over; top with cilantro leaves. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.
