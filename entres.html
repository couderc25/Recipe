                        <span>
                            4 Servings
                            ½ medium head of green cabbage (about 2 lb.)
                            2 medium shallots (about 4 oz.)
                            1 1" piece ginger
                            2 garlic cloves
                            1 serrano or other green chile
                            3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
                            1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
                            1 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk
                            1 15.5-oz. can chickpeas
                            1 tsp. brown mustard seeds
                            1 tsp. ground cumin
                            1 tsp. turmeric powder
                            ½ cup vegetable stock or water
                            Freshly ground black pepper
                            Steamed white rice, cilantro leaves, and lime wedges (for serving)

                            Step 1
                            To start, prep your ingredients: Slice ½ medium head of green cabbage (about 2 lb.) through core to make 4 wedges. Peel and finely chop 2 medium shallots (about 4 oz.). Peel one 1" piece ginger with a spoon and finely chop. Using the side of your knife, crush 2 garlic cloves, remove and discard papery skins, and finely chop. Halve 1 serrano or other green chile lengthwise and, if you don’t want it too hot, scrape out seeds and white membrane with the back of the knife; discard. If you prefer some heat, leave as is. Finely chop chile. Set shallots, ginger, garlic, and chile aside.
                            Step 2
                            Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large high-sided skillet with lid or wide Dutch oven over medium-high. Add cabbage, cut side down, and season with kosher salt. Cook, undisturbed, until lightly charred underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook, undisturbed, until charred, about 5 minutes. Transfer cabbage to a plate.
                            Step 3
                            Shake one 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk to ensure it’s well mixed; open can. Open one 15.5-oz. can chickpeas and rinse in a colander under running water.
                            Step 4
                            Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in same skillet over medium-high. Add reserved shallots, ginger, garlic, and chile, and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1 tsp. brown mustard seeds, 1 tsp. ground cumin, and 1 tsp. turmeric powder and cook, stirring, until mustard seeds are popping, about 1 minute.
                            Step 5
                            Add coconut milk, chickpeas, ½ cup vegetable stock or water, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Stir to combine.
                            Step 6
                            Place cabbage wedges back into pan and, using a large spoon, baste cabbage with coconut milk; bring mixture to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until cabbage is tender, 15–20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
                            Step 7
                            Scoop some steamed white rice into each bowl and divide cabbage and chickpeas over; top with cilantro leaves. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.

                        <h3 id="en3">Sourdough Pizza</h3>
                        <span>
                            Ingredients:
                            - 6 ¾ cups  flour
                            - 2 ¾ cups warm water (~90°F)
                            - 1 tbsp + ¾ tsp salt
                            - ½ cups + 2 tbsp sourdough starter

                            1. 8 to 12 hours after feeding starter, combine the flour and water in a 12-quart round tub. Mix by hand just until incorporated. Cover and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.

                            2. Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough. Add starter and mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn't stick to you. Enclose the salt and starter by gently picking up the dough from underneath and stretching in three or four folds. Use the pincer method (see misc/notes on this) alternating with folding the dough to fully integrate the ingredients. Do this for about 5 min. You want the ingredients to be fully mixed.

                            3. The dough needs one or two folds. Make these folds in the first 30min – 2h. After the final fold, lightly coat the dough and the bottom of the tub with olive oil to help prevent sticking. When the dough is 2 to 2½ times its original volume, 12 to 14 hours after mixing, it's ready to be divided.

                            4. Moderately flour a work surface. With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the tub. Dust the top of the dough and then cut into 5 pieces. 

                            5. Shape each piece of dough into a medium-tight round working gently and being careful not to degas the dough. See instructions for shaping dough ball in misc/notes.

                            6. Put the dough balls on a lightly floured baking sheet, leaving space between them to allow for expansion. Lightly oil or flour the tops, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours (if you want to make pizza sooner, let the dough balls you'll be using sit out at room temperature for 1 hour, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before shaping).  Dough will keep for 2 or 3 days if stored in the refrigerator and tightly covered. The longer It stays in the refrigerator the more flavor it will have

                            7. Pre-heat oven as hot as you can with pizza stone in it. 

                            8. Remove dough from fridge and put on floured work surface. Pat down and then flip over and repeat making sure that both sides are well flowered. Punch down in the middle leaving a bit on the edge that is uncompressed. Use both hands and hold the rim letting the dough hang vertically and slowly rotate your hands around the rim a few times allowing gravity to stretch it. Drape the dough over your fists and gently stretch it out until it is thin enough.

                            9. Put dough on well-floured cutting board and add toppings. Put in oven and let it cook. The hottest I can get my oven is 525°F and I cook it for 7 min which turns out pretty well.

                            Notes:
                            -Cut dough into more or less then 5 pieces based on size of pizza you want. 5 pieces work pretty well for 10-12 inch pizzas.
                            -I don’t have a pizza stone so I use a large (10inch) cast iron pan instead.
