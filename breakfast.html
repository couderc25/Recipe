                        <span>
                            INGREDIENTS
                            3 eggs
                            1 tablespoon sugar
                            1½ cups milk
                            ¼ teaspoon salt
                            1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour
                            2 tablespoons melted butter
                            
                            1. Put all the ingredients in a blender in the order listed and blend until smooth. Remove the lid and scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. Briefly blend the mixture again. Set the covered blender in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or even overnight.
                            
                            2. When it's time to cook the crepes, use a paper towel to spread about 1 teaspoon of butter or vegetable oil in the bottom of an 8- or 9-inch shallow nonstick trying pan and place over medium heat. Blend the batter again to smooth it.
                            3. For the first crepe, pour ¼ to ⅓ cup of batter into a measuring cup to gauge how much to use. For the rest of the crepes, pour approximately that much batter right from the blender.
                            4. Adjust the heat if they brown too quickly or too slowly.
                            Makes 12 crepes.
                            Note: I often add some water to thin the batter out if I am doing it on the stove so that it spreads better

                        <span>
                            4 Servings
                            ½ medium head of green cabbage (about 2 lb.)
                            2 medium shallots (about 4 oz.)
                            1 1" piece ginger
                            2 garlic cloves
                            1 serrano or other green chile
                            3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
                            1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
                            1 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk
                            1 15.5-oz. can chickpeas
                            1 tsp. brown mustard seeds
                            1 tsp. ground cumin
                            1 tsp. turmeric powder
                            ½ cup vegetable stock or water
                            Freshly ground black pepper
                            Steamed white rice, cilantro leaves, and lime wedges (for serving)

                            Step 1
                            To start, prep your ingredients: Slice ½ medium head of green cabbage (about 2 lb.) through core to make 4 wedges. Peel and finely chop 2 medium shallots (about 4 oz.). Peel one 1" piece ginger with a spoon and finely chop. Using the side of your knife, crush 2 garlic cloves, remove and discard papery skins, and finely chop. Halve 1 serrano or other green chile lengthwise and, if you don’t want it too hot, scrape out seeds and white membrane with the back of the knife; discard. If you prefer some heat, leave as is. Finely chop chile. Set shallots, ginger, garlic, and chile aside.
                            Step 2
                            Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large high-sided skillet with lid or wide Dutch oven over medium-high. Add cabbage, cut side down, and season with kosher salt. Cook, undisturbed, until lightly charred underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook, undisturbed, until charred, about 5 minutes. Transfer cabbage to a plate.
                            Step 3
                            Shake one 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk to ensure it’s well mixed; open can. Open one 15.5-oz. can chickpeas and rinse in a colander under running water.
                            Step 4
                            Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in same skillet over medium-high. Add reserved shallots, ginger, garlic, and chile, and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1 tsp. brown mustard seeds, 1 tsp. ground cumin, and 1 tsp. turmeric powder and cook, stirring, until mustard seeds are popping, about 1 minute.
                            Step 5
                            Add coconut milk, chickpeas, ½ cup vegetable stock or water, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Stir to combine.
                            Step 6
                            Place cabbage wedges back into pan and, using a large spoon, baste cabbage with coconut milk; bring mixture to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until cabbage is tender, 15–20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
                            Step 7
                            Scoop some steamed white rice into each bowl and divide cabbage and chickpeas over; top with cilantro leaves. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.
