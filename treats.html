            <h3 id="tr1">Fruit Crisp</h3>
            <span>Prep: 30 minutes Bake: 30 minutes Oven: 375°F  Makes: 6 servings
                5 cups sliced, peeled cooking apples, pears, peaches, or apricots or frozen unsweetened peach slices
                2 to 4 tablespoons granulated sugar
                ½ cup regular rolled oats
                ½ cup packed brown sugar
                ¼ cup all-purpose flour
                ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg or cinnamon
                ¼ cup butter or margarine
                ¼ cup chopped nuts or coconut
                Vanilla ice cream (optional)
                
                
                
                1. Preheat oven to 375°F. If fruit is frozen, thaw
                but do not drain. Place fruit in a 2-quart square
                baking dish. Stir in the granulated sugar.
                2. For topping, in a medium bowl combine the
                oats, brown sugar, flour, and nutmeg. Cut in
                butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
                Stir in the nuts. Sprinkle topping over filling.
                3. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes (40 minutes for
                thawed fruit) or until fruit is tender and topping
                is golden. Cool slightly. If desired, serve warm</span>

                Melody Overstreet's Scones
                Ingredients:
                3 Cups Unbleached flour 
                1 tablespoon baking powder
                1 teaspoon salt
                ¼  to ⅓ cup cane sugar
                1 ⅓ to 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream
                Additional heavy cream for brushing on scones
                Extra cane sugar for top of scones 
                6.5 - 7 ounces fresh strawberries chopped into medium small pieces
                
                Directions
                - Preheat oven to 375- 425 degrees F (heat varies depending on oven - 375 in convection 400 w/ home oven)
                - Weigh out dry mixture and whisk together 
                - Add cut fruit to dry mixture and toss until fruit is covered 
                - Slowly add heavy cream, folding into mixture, careful not to overmix or add too much cream. Add enough cream so that the mixture is moist enough to come together (likely less is needed than expected)
                - Combine dough into an even round ball
                - Dust flour onto a cutting board 
                - Place ball onto cutting board and pat down until you have a disk roughly 2 inches thick 
                - Cut into 8 triangular pieces
                - Cut parchment paper to fit baking sheet, and place the scones onto the parchment paper
                - Brush cream onto the top of the scones using a pastry brush, then sprinkle sugar on top
                - Bake for ~8 minutes, then rotate tray 180 degrees and bake for another 7 minute. Timing dependent on preference and oven.
                - Scones are done when lightly golden on top</span>
